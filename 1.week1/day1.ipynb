To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of\\nmessages\\nto the\\n.invoke\\nmethod.\\nfrom\\nlangchain_core\\n.\\nmessages\\nimport\\nHumanMessage\\n,\\nSystemMessage\\nmessages\\n=\\n[\\nSystemMessage\\n(\\n\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"\\n)\\n,\\nHumanMessage\\n(\\n\"hi!\"\\n)\\n,\\n]\\nmodel\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\nmessages\\n)\\nAPI Reference:\\nHumanMessage\\n|\\nSystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntip\\nIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the\\nLangSmith trace\\n. The LangSmith trace reports\\ntoken\\nusage information, latency,\\nstandard model parameters\\n(such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive\\nmessage\\nobjects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational\\nroles\\nand hold important data, such as\\ntool calls\\nand token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or\\nOpenAI format\\n. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\n\"Hello\"\\n)\\nmodel\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\n[\\n{\\n\"role\"\\n:\\n\"user\"\\n,\\n\"content\"\\n:\\n\"Hello\"\\n}\\n]\\n)\\nmodel\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\n[\\nHumanMessage\\n(\\n\"Hello\"\\n)\\n]\\n)\\nStreaming\\n\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are\\nRunnables\\n, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor\\ntoken\\nin\\nmodel\\n.\\nstream\\n(\\nmessages\\n)\\n:\\nprint\\n(\\ntoken\\n.\\ncontent\\n,\\nend\\n=\\n\"|\"\\n)\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in\\nthis guide\\n.\\nPrompt Templates\\n\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates\\nare a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\nlanguage\\n: The language to translate text into\\ntext\\n: The text to translate\\nfrom\\nlangchain_core\\n.\\nprompts\\nimport\\nChatPromptTemplate\\nsystem_template\\n=\\n\"Translate the following from English into {language}\"\\nprompt_template\\n=\\nChatPromptTemplate\\n.\\nfrom_messages\\n(\\n[\\n(\\n\"system\"\\n,\\nsystem_template\\n)\\n,\\n(\\n\"user\"\\n,\\n\"{text}\"\\n)\\n]\\n)\\nAPI Reference:\\nChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that\\nChatPromptTemplate\\nsupports multiple\\nmessage roles\\nin a single template. We format the\\nlanguage\\nparameter into the system message, and the user\\ntext\\ninto a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt\\n=\\nprompt_template\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\n{\\n\"language\"\\n:\\n\"Italian\"\\n,\\n\"text\"\\n:\\n\"hi!\"\\n}\\n)\\nprompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a\\nChatPromptValue\\nthat consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt\\n.\\nto_messages\\n(\\n)\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\\nHumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse\\n=\\nmodel\\n.\\ninvoke\\n(\\nprompt\\n)\\nprint\\n(\\nresponse\\n.\\ncontent\\n)\\nCiao!\\ntip\\nMessage\\ncontent\\ncan contain both text and\\ncontent blocks\\nwith additional structure. See\\nthis guide\\nfor more information.\\nIf we take a look at the\\nLangSmith trace\\n, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with\\ntoken\\nusage information, latency,\\nstandard model parameters\\n(such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\n\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it! In this tutorial you\\'ve learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You\\'ve learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\\nThis just scratches the surface of what you will want to learn to become a proficient AI Engineer.
